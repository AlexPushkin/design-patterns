Definition
===
_Defines an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide 
which class to instantiate. The Factory method lets a class defer 
instantiation it uses to subclasses._

Uses
===
1. You need to separate creational logic from the class implementation code.
2. You need to create new objects without having to know the details of how they're created.
3. You dont rely on concrete classes but on interfaces.
